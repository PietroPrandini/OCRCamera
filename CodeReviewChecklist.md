# Pietro Prandini code review's checklist

## Keep in mind
* The code review is a change to learn together;
* for every doubts, ask first;
* take your time for doing an accurate review;
* find the bad and the well things of the code;
* have respect for the coder and his code.

## Pay attention to
* Comments and specifications about the code (is it properly commented? All is it clear and well documented?);
* code's modularity (is the code modular and sustainable?);
* code's readability (is the code easily readable?);
* code's functionality (are the tools used properly used?);
* exceptions (are the exceptions caught or launched properly?);
* document's style respect (is the document style respected?);
* naming (are the variables and the methods' name reveal the scope of them?);
* avoid hard coding.
